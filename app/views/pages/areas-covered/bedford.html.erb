            <p>Bedford is a popular country town in Bedfordshire, England. Although a country based town it has excellent transport links to London and other city centres, which had made it ideal for people with mobility concerns to commute and get about. Due to the ever-changing requirements of residents, we have received lots of custom in the area.</p>

            <p>A customer called us to arrange a stairlift removal as soon as possible, as she had an appointment for a new lift fitted shortly but had just been informed they would not remove the existing used stairlift unless an expensive removal service charge was added.</p>

            <p>Our staff at We Buy Any Stairlift were able to book in a swift and reliable removal to allow our customer to make the changes she needed to improve her circumstances.</p>

            <p>“Very happy with the service. Thank you to Josh [engineer] who was polite and professional throughout and made sure I was happy before he left. I have recommended to all my friends who use stairlifts to help with getting about.”</p>
