            <p>An elderly lady called us and wanted her stairlift removed as it was no longer needed due to a bereavement, but she was very wary about letting a stranger into the house. As many of the companies she had looked at were small companies with no formal website she was relieved to find a genuine registered company who she could put her trust in. The feedback she gave us (below) is a reflection of our helpful staff who care about their customer and making sure their home is left in a tidy, respectful state.</p>

            <p>“Came out really quick and the man that came was really friendly, did not feel threatened having him in the house and cleaned up the area afterwards. I’d recommend to friends and family.”</p>
