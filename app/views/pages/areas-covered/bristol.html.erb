            <p>A prospective customer contacted us to get some general stairlift advice, since we are one of the leading experts in the profession we were able to give him advice on whether he should have his lift removed to replace it. In the end, the customer realised that to accommodate his needs he would have to part with his old lift and make room for the new. We were able to work around the customer’s holidays and appointments to make an arrangement that worked for everyone, and offered him a great price for his unwanted stairlift.</p>

            <p>“Very pleased, thank you for your advice it was very helpful when deciding what to do”</p>

            <p>James, Bristol</p>
