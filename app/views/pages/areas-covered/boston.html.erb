            <p>A customer we spoke with recently was very impressed with our service and the price offered for her used stairlift. She was concerned the lift was outdated, and not in perfect condition. However, she was able to send us photographs so we could determine the exact condition and model of stairlift, so we could make a fair offer without any catches, or broken promises. Our customer was very happy with what was discussed and we came out to remove the lift within 5 working days, to our customer’s convenience.</p>

            <p>“I was very impressed with the cash offered for my Stairlift which was quite outdated. I nearly paid a company to remove it just to be rid of it but thankfully we found We Buy Any Stairlift! I would recommend to anyone who has bought a house with a stairlift and doesn’t know what to do with it.”</p>
